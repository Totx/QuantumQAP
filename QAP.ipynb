The Q matrix is a $n^2 \\times nÂ²$ matrix, where each position corresponds to the quadratic coefficient of any assignment of a facility to a location to any other of that sort. Moreover, the Q matrix also considers the constraints of the problem. This is the QAP model:\n",

For the later, a discrete parameter P (the Lagrange parameter) that is adjusted to capture the strength of each constraint is defined.\n",
